# datacover-123 : Decentralized File storage and sharing platform

![datacover](https://bafkreievjsq4glmoz4lzvwob6yfsaifpbufsnj47oz47ml4oa6dh4enhbi.ipfs.nftstorage.link/)

## Introduction

datacover-123 is a web3 project with the aim of helping users store files and share them in a user-friendly manner. Decentralized file storage and sharing system. This project intends to build a web3 version of google drive or dropbox for file storage and sharing. It uses the open zeppelin ERC721 standard to store file metadata ERI in an EVM-based smart contract. The smart contract is deployed on Polygon Mumbai. Polygon which is an Ethereum scaling and POS Blockchain was the best choice for deployment to reduce the cost of transactions and interaction with the blockchain.

## Web 3.0 technologies Used

Frontend: NextJS, postcss, tailwindcss, Theme
web3 technologies: IPFS/Filecoin, Metamask wallet, Unstoppable domain, Tableland, Valist, XMTP, ChainLink
Backend: Solidity, Node.js

Blockchain deployed to:  Filecoin Chain 

## Description

This project was made using several technologies. The front-end was designed using a server-side-rendering javascript tech known as NextJS. the latest version of Next was used because of how fast it was to build the project.  IPFS / Filecoin's NFT.Storage was used to store user's file on their decentralized storage. Files can be stored individually and as a folder. When Files are stored on IPFS through NFT.Storage, It is retrieved and rendered on users dashboard whenever they are logged in. They can share these files to anyone through a sharing mechanism that is easy to copy out the sharing IPFS URL.
Tableland saved user's details
Valist houses the code repository

 XMTP is used for wallet to wallet messaging using the XMTP SDK

The smart contract uses ERC-721 specification to hold metadata URI, ethers.js was used to interact with the smart contract. The contract was deployed to Filecoin blockchain. The entire project demo was hosted to Vercel.

SPs with an established track record would take out insurance policies that protect them from active faults and ensure an active revenue stream in the case of failure. Certain characteristics (such as payment history, length of operation, availability, etc) can be used to craft insurance policies just as they can be used to underwrite loans to SPs.

In exchange for recurrent insurance premium payments, this protocol would check if the SP is in good standing with the Filecoin network. If it isn’t in good standing, the SP could issue a claim that the protocol would review and issue a payout if all coverage criteria were met.

Storage insurance brokers or marketplaces could emerge to offer single points of subscription and management for clients and providers.

In some ways, this is similar to Nexus Mutual for SPs on FVM. While Nexus guards against contract failure, this protocol would help SPs recover from an active fault or termination.

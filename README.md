# Project Name: Data Insurance

### Introduction:
Data Insurance on Decentralized Storage using Filecoin FEVM is a pioneering project aimed at revolutionizing the insurance industry by leveraging decentralized storage solutions provided by Filecoin's Filecoin EVM (FEVM). This project seeks to offer innovative insurance products tailored to the unique needs of businesses and individuals utilizing decentralized storage for their valuable data assets. By harnessing the security, reliability, and transparency of decentralized storage on Filecoin FEVM, Data Insurance aims to provide unparalleled protection against data loss, theft, and corruption.

### Problem Statement:
Traditional data storage solutions face various challenges, including centralized vulnerabilities, single points of failure, and lack of transparency. Moreover, businesses and individuals utilizing decentralized storage solutions may encounter uncertainties regarding data integrity, availability, and security. There is a pressing need for robust insurance products specifically designed to address the risks associated with decentralized storage and provide peace of mind to users.

### Objectives:
 
1. To develop innovative insurance policies tailored to the unique characteristics of decentralized storage on Filecoin FEVM.
2. To provide comprehensive coverage for data loss, theft, corruption, and other related risks specific to decentralized storage environments.
3. To leverage Filecoin FEVM's security features and transparency to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of insurance offerings.
4. To establish a seamless and efficient platform for purchasing insurance, filing claims, and accessing support services in the decentralized storage ecosystem.

## Features:

Decentralized Insurance Policies: Insurance policies specifically designed for users of decentralized storage solutions on Filecoin FEVM.
Comprehensive Coverage: Coverage for various risks, including data loss, theft, corruption, cyber-attacks, and natural disasters, tailored to decentralized storage environments.
Smart Contract Automation: Utilization of smart contracts on Filecoin FEVM for automated policy issuance, claims processing, and premium payments, ensuring transparency and efficiency.
Transparent Claim Verification: Transparent and auditable claim verification process facilitated by the immutability of blockchain records on Filecoin FEVM.
Community Governance: Community-driven governance mechanisms allowing stakeholders to participate in policy decisions, premium adjustments, and risk management strategies.

### Technology Stack:

Filecoin FEVM: Utilizing Filecoin's Filecoin EVM (FEVM) for decentralized storage and execution of smart contracts.
Smart Contracts: Implementing smart contracts on Filecoin FEVM using Solidity or other compatible programming languages for automation of insurance processes.
Blockchain: Leveraging the security, transparency, and immutability of the Filecoin blockchain for recording insurance transactions, policies, and claims.
Decentralized Identity: Integration of decentralized identity solutions for user authentication, verification, and authorization on the Data Insurance platform.

### Implementation:
The Data Insurance platform was developed as a decentralized application (dApp) accessible through web and mobile interfaces. Smart contracts was deployed on Filecoin FEVM (Callibration Testnet) to automate insurance processes, including policy issuance, premium payments, and claims processing. The platform's frontend will provide a user-friendly interface for policyholders to purchase insurance, file claims, and access support services. Advanced encryption algorithms will ensure the security and privacy of user data and transactions.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introduction

datacover-123 is a web3 project with the aim of helping users store files and share them in a user-friendly manner. Decentralized file storage and sharing system. This project intends to build a web3 version of google drive or dropbox for file storage and sharing. It uses the open zeppelin ERC721 standard to store file metadata ERI in an EVM-based smart contract. The smart contract is deployed on Polygon Mumbai. Polygon which is an Ethereum scaling and POS Blockchain was the best choice for deployment to reduce the cost of transactions and interaction with the blockchain.

## Web 3.0 technologies Used

Frontend: NextJS, postcss, tailwindcss, Theme
web3 technologies: IPFS/Filecoin, Metamask wallet, Unstoppable domain, Tableland, Valist, XMTP, ChainLink
Backend: Solidity, Node.js

Blockchain deployed to:  Filecoin Chain

### Advert 3:

##### Title: "Data Protection Made Easy with Data Insurance Cover!"

SPs with an established track record would take out insurance policies that protect them from active faults and ensure an active revenue stream in the case of failure. Certain characteristics (such as payment history, length of operation, availability, etc) can be used to craft insurance policies just as they can be used to underwrite loans to SPs.

In exchange for recurrent insurance premium payments, this protocol would check if the SP is in good standing with the Filecoin network. If it isn’t in good standing, the SP could issue a claim that the protocol would review and issue a payout if all coverage criteria were met.

Storage insurance brokers or marketplaces could emerge to offer single points of subscription and management for clients and providers.

In some ways, this is similar to Nexus Mutual for SPs on FVM. While Nexus guards against contract failure, this protocol would help SPs recover from an active fault or termination.

# Future Integrations (Whats next after the hackathon)
1. Add Event listeners to the smart contract.
2. Making the contract more gas efficient using Error() instead of require().Add 
3. Adding more admin features to add accountability.
4. Including Statistical charts and improving on the frontend.
5. Engaging with IPFS/Filecoin team to integrate the API of storage providers to help onboarding them for insurance cover.
6. Certain characteristics (such as payment history, length of operation, availability, etc) can be used to craft insurance policies just as they can be used to underwrite loans to SPs.
7. A profile database to house users details.

### Conclusion:
Data Insurance on Decentralized Storage using Filecoin FEVM represents a groundbreaking initiative in the insurance industry, offering innovative solutions tailored to the needs of users in decentralized storage environments. By harnessing the security, transparency, and efficiency of Filecoin FEVM and blockchain technology, Data Insurance aims to provide unparalleled protection and peace of mind to businesses and individuals leveraging decentralized storage solutions. This project has the potential to transform the insurance landscape and contribute to the widespread adoption of decentralized technologies for data storage and protection.
